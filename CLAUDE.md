# Claude Code Configuration

## Git Configuration
- Repository: https://github.com/huckfinne-a/toeqbank.git
- GitHub Token: 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

## Development Commands
- Frontend: `npm start` (port 3000)
- Backend: `npm run dev` (port 3001)
- Build frontend: `npm run build`
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Database: PostgreSQL (check if service is running with `brew services list`)

## Deployment
- Platform: Digital Ocean App Platform
- Deployment triggers automatically on push to main branch
- **IMPORTANT: Always commit and push changes to deploy them**

## Claude Code Workflow Rules
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH AFTER EVERY CHANGE** ðŸš¨

1. **MANDATORY: Push after completing ANY task** - Digital Ocean auto-deploys from GitHub
2. **MANDATORY: Push after ANY file modification** - Even small fixes need deployment
3. **Use descriptive commit messages** with the standard footer
4. **Check build status** after pushing (builds take ~30 seconds) 
5. **Test locally first** with `npm run build` to catch TypeScript errors

### Commit Checklist:
- [ ] Made changes to code/files?
- [ ] Built successfully with `npm run build`?  
- [ ] Added, committed, and pushed changes?
- [ ] Verified deployment started on Digital Ocean?

## Common Issues
- If git push fails, use: `git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/huckfinne-a/toeqbank.git`
- If PostgreSQL connection fails, start with: `brew services start postgresql`
