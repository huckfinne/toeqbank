# Admin User Control Panel

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive admin user control panel that allows administrators to manage system users. This includes creating accounts, editing user information, resetting passwords, and managing admin privileges.

## Features Added

### Backend (API Endpoints)

1. **Admin Middleware** (`requireAdmin`) - Ensures only admin users can access admin endpoints
2. **User Management Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/auth/admin/users` - List all users
   - `POST /api/auth/admin/users` - Create new user
   - `PUT /api/auth/admin/users/:id` - Update user information
   - `DELETE /api/auth/admin/users/:id` - Delete user (soft delete)
   - `POST /api/auth/admin/users/:id/reset-password` - Reset user password

3. **Enhanced User Model** with:
   - `findAll()` - Get all active users
   - `deleteUser()` - Soft delete user
   - Support for `is_admin` field in user creation

### Frontend (Admin Panel)

1. **Admin User Panel Component** (`AdminUserPanel.tsx`):
   - **User List**: View all system users with role badges
   - **Create User Form**: Add new users with optional admin privileges
   - **Edit User Modal**: Update user information and admin status
   - **Password Reset**: Reset any user's password securely
   - **Delete User**: Remove users with confirmation dialog

2. **Navigation Integration**: Admin panel link appears only for admin users

3. **Admin Service** (`adminApi.ts`): Clean API integration for all admin operations

## Security Features

- **Admin-only access**: All admin endpoints require admin privileges
- **Self-protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
- **Input validation**: Email format, password strength, username requirements
- **Unique constraints**: Prevents duplicate usernames and emails
- **Soft deletes**: Users are deactivated rather than permanently deleted

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd toeqbank-backend
npm run dev
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd toeqbank-frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Access Admin Panel

1. **Login as an admin user** (you'll need to set `is_admin = true` for at least one user in the database)
2. **Navigate to Admin Panel** - The "Admin Panel" link will appear in the navigation bar for admin users
3. **Go to `/admin/users`** to access the user management interface

### 3. Admin Panel Features

**Create New Users:**
- Click "Create New User" button
- Fill out the form with required information
- Optionally check "Administrator privileges" to make them an admin
- Password must be at least 6 characters

**Edit Existing Users:**
- Click "Edit" next to any user
- Update their information and admin status
- Changes are saved immediately

**Reset Passwords:**
- Click "Reset Password" next to any user
- Enter a new password (minimum 6 characters)
- User will need to login with the new password

**Delete Users:**
- Click "Delete" next to any user
- Confirm the deletion in the dialog
- Users are soft-deleted (deactivated) for data integrity

## Database Schema

The system uses these key tables:
- `users` - User accounts with admin flags
- All admin operations respect the `is_active` flag for soft deletes

## API Authentication

All admin endpoints require:
1. Valid JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
2. User must have `is_admin = true` in the database
3. Token must be from an active user account

## Error Handling

The admin panel includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors are displayed to the user
- Validation errors show specific field issues
- Success messages confirm completed operations
- Loading states provide user feedback

## Next Steps

To get started:
1. **Create an admin user** in your database by setting `is_admin = true` for an existing user
2. **Login with admin credentials** 
3. **Access `/admin/users`** to start managing user accounts

The admin panel is now fully functional and ready for production use!
