# Reviewer Role Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a new "reviewer" user type with dedicated functionality for reviewing questions. Reviewers have access to a special Review Queue section in the navigation bar where they can approve or reject questions.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Schema
- **Added `is_reviewer` column** to the `users` table with default value `FALSE`
- **Created database index** for efficient reviewer queries
- **Migration applied** successfully to existing database

#### 2. User Model Updates
- Updated `User` interface to include `is_reviewer: boolean` field
- Updated `CreateUserRequest` interface to support reviewer role assignment
- Modified all user-related database queries to include `is_reviewer` field
- Updated user creation, updating, and retrieval methods

#### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- **Enhanced auth middleware** with new `requireReviewer` function
- **Admins inherit reviewer privileges** - they can access reviewer functions too
- **Updated all auth endpoints** to include `is_reviewer` in user data
- **Updated admin endpoints** to allow setting reviewer status

#### 4. API Endpoints Enhanced
- All user management endpoints now handle `is_reviewer` field
- Admin panel can create users with reviewer privileges
- User profile endpoints return reviewer status
- Token verification includes reviewer information

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Authentication Context
- Updated `User` interface to include `is_reviewer` field
- Added `isReviewer` computed property (true for reviewers OR admins)
- Updated all authentication flows to handle reviewer status

#### 2. Reviewer Dashboard
- **Created comprehensive ReviewerDashboard component** (`/reviewer/dashboard`)
- **Features include:**
  - **Statistics dashboard** showing pending, approved, rejected question counts
  - **Filterable question list** (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
  - **Question review interface** with full question display
  - **Approve/Reject functionality** with review notes
  - **Professional UI** with status badges and clear workflows

#### 3. Navigation & Routing
- **Added "Review Queue" link** in navigation (visible only to reviewers/admins)
- **New route `/reviewer/dashboard`** for the reviewer interface
- **Conditional rendering** based on user permissions

#### 4. Admin Panel Updates
- **Enhanced user creation form** with reviewer checkbox
- **Updated user editing** to manage reviewer status
- **Visual role indicators** showing Admin, Reviewer, or User badges
- **Support for users with multiple roles** (Admin + Reviewer)

## User Role Hierarchy

1. **Admin**: Has all privileges (admin + reviewer + user)
2. **Reviewer**: Has reviewer + user privileges
3. **User**: Has basic user privileges only

## How to Use

### 1. Creating Reviewer Users

**Via Admin Panel:**
1. Login as an admin
2. Navigate to Admin Panel
3. Click "Create New User"
4. Fill out the form and check "Reviewer privileges"
5. Submit to create the reviewer account

**Via Database (temporary):**
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_reviewer = true WHERE username = 'reviewer_username';
```

### 2. Accessing Reviewer Features

1. **Login as a reviewer** (or admin)
2. **"Review Queue" link appears** in the navigation bar
3. **Click "Review Queue"** to access the reviewer dashboard
4. **Review questions** by clicking the "Review" button
5. **Approve or reject** with optional notes

### 3. Reviewer Dashboard Features

- **Stats Overview**: See total, pending, approved, and rejected question counts
- **Filter Tabs**: Switch between All, Pending, Approved, and Rejected questions
- **Question Cards**: Preview questions with status and metadata
- **Review Modal**: Full question display with answer choices and explanation
- **Review Actions**: Approve, reject with notes, or cancel
- **Quick Navigation**: Links to full question view

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Users table now includes:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_reviewer BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_is_reviewer ON users(is_reviewer) WHERE is_reviewer = true;
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/admin/users` - Returns users with reviewer status
- `POST /api/auth/admin/users` - Create users with reviewer privileges
- `PUT /api/auth/admin/users/:id` - Update user reviewer status
- All auth endpoints return `is_reviewer` field

### Frontend Components
- `ReviewerDashboard` - Main reviewer interface
- Updated `AdminUserPanel` - Manages reviewer assignments
- Updated `AuthContext` - Handles reviewer permissions
- Updated navigation and routing

## Security Features

- **Role-based access control**: Only reviewers/admins can access review functions
- **Middleware protection**: `requireReviewer` middleware protects reviewer endpoints
- **Admin oversight**: Admins can manage who gets reviewer privileges
- **Audit trail**: Review actions can be logged (review notes stored)

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a foundation for:
1. **Question review workflow** with approval/rejection
2. **Review history tracking** and audit trails
3. **Notification system** for reviewers
4. **Review assignment** and workload management
5. **Quality metrics** and reviewer performance tracking

## Ready to Use

The reviewer system is now fully functional! 

**To get started:**
1. **Backend is running** with all reviewer endpoints active
2. **Database schema is updated** with reviewer support
3. **Admin panel is ready** to create reviewer accounts  
4. **Reviewer dashboard is live** at `/reviewer/dashboard`

Simply create a reviewer account through the admin panel and start using the Review Queue!
